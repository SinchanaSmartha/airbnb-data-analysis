# Airbnb Data Analysis

An Airbnb data analysis project using only core Python and NumPy. Includes data cleaning, transformation, outlier handling, and insights â€” all built from scratch without using Pandas.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project explores a real-world Airbnb listings dataset using only core Python libraries and NumPy â€” without using Pandas or visualization tools like Matplotlib.  
The goal was to challenge conventional workflows and show that meaningful insights can still be extracted using just fundamental tools.

## ðŸ§  Motivation

I wanted to challenge myself by doing this project without using Pandas or Matplotlib â€” just plain Python and NumPy.  
It helped me really understand how data works behind the scenes â€” from raw CSVs to cleaning, grouping, and analyzing.

I didnâ€™t want to just follow tutorials; I wanted to build something from scratch that felt like my own effort.  
This also gave me something unique and honest to add to my portfolio as I prepare for university admissions.

I did everything manually â€” from loading the CSV file to cleaning and analyzing the data â€” without relying on high-level tools. It was tough at times, but worth it.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- *Source*: [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)  
- *Format*: CSV  
- *Location*: London  
- *Features Used*:
  - price
  - neighbourhood
  - minimum_nights
  - reviews_per_month
  - last_review
  - number_of_reviews

## âš™ Project Workflow

1. *CSV Loading* â€“ Done using csv.reader (not Pandas).  
2. *Basic Exploration* â€“ Row count, header analysis, sample prints.  
3. *Data Cleaning* â€“ Handled missing values in price, reviews_per_month, and last_review. Converted strings to float.  
4. *Outlier Detection and Removal* â€“ Removed unrealistic values in price and minimum_nights.  
5. *Descriptive Statistics* â€“ Used NumPy to calculate mean, median, and percentiles.  
6. *Neighbourhood-Level Analysis* â€“ Found top 10 cheapest neighbourhoods by average price.

## ðŸ§© Key Challenges

- Handling missing data without Pandas  
- Performing operations like group-by manually  
- Working with date columns without the datetime library  
- Skipping visual validation â€” all verification was done numerically

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

- The majority of listings are reasonably priced, but some outliers exist.  
- A few listings had extreme outliers that could distort trends if not removed.  
- The final list of cheapest neighbourhoods could help low-budget travelers.

## ðŸ’¬ Final Thoughts

This project taught me how much we usually rely on libraries.  
There were moments I felt stuck, but solving problems on my own was the best part.  
Now I feel more confident working with raw data and understanding whatâ€™s going on under the hood.

It also made me realize I enjoy figuring things out, even if it takes longer â€” and thatâ€™s probably the mindset I want to carry forward in the future.
